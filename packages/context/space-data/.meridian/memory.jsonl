Existing solutions fragmented across multiple sites with no unified access. **Alternatives:** Simple API wrapper (rejected: no value-add, no caching, no real-time), single-domain focus like just satellites (rejected: user wanted comprehensive coverage), client-side only without backend (rejected: exposes API keys, no caching, rate limit issues), REST-only without WebSocket (rejected: user wanted real-time updates). **Trade-offs:** Comprehensive scope increases complexity (58 files, 18K lines); accepted for unique value proposition. Monorepo structure adds overhead but ensures type sharing and unified architecture. 9 API clients to maintain vs simplicity; accepted for complete coverage. **Impact/Scope:** Establishes reusable pattern for multi-API aggregation platforms. Demonstrates: (1) Base APIClient class with intelligent caching by data volatility (5s for ISS to 24hr for static data), (2) Rate limit management with automatic retry and fallback APIs, (3) WebSocket real-time streaming architecture, (4) Monorepo structure with shared types package, (5) Production error handling with graceful degradation, (6) Space-themed UI with glassmorphism and animations. Applicable to any domain requiring multiple API aggregation (weather, financial, news, etc.). **Pattern:** For multi-API platforms: (1) Create base client class with protected cachedGet/get methods, (2) Extend per service with specific TTLs based on data volatility, (3) Implement cache-first strategy with error fallback, (4) Use WebSocket for fast-changing data (5s updates), (5) Provide rate limit info in API responses, (6) Structure as monorepo: shared types + backend aggregator + frontend consumer, (7) Use TypeScript strict mode throughout for type safety, (8) Document all 50+ data sources in comprehensive guide.", "tags": ["architecture", "pattern", "api", "caching", "real-time", "monorepo", "multi-api-aggregation"], "links": ["cosmic-atlas", "https://github.com/consigcody94/cosmic-atlas", "~/cosmic-atlas/packages/backend/src/utils/api-client.ts", "~/cosmic-atlas/packages/backend/src/services/", "~/space_data_apis_comprehensive_guide.md"]}
