{"id": "mem-0001", "timestamp": "2025-11-20T17:51:22Z", "summary": "**Decision:** Build ServiceNow dashboard generator using question engine + code generator + MCP server architecture for guided configuration and natural language code generation. **Problem:** Creating ServiceNow dashboards requires deep platform knowledge, manual XML/JS/CSS coding, and understanding of table structures, widget types, and ServiceNow best practices. Non-technical users can't generate dashboards; developers spend hours on repetitive widget code. **Alternatives:** Direct code generation without questions (rejected: no user guidance), template-only approach (rejected: inflexible), ServiceNow native tools only (rejected: still requires technical knowledge), purely programmatic API (rejected: no natural language support). **Trade-offs:** Question engine adds complexity vs simple templates; accepted for flexibility and guided experience. Table generator has sophisticated type inference logic (650 lines) for amazing out-of-box experience (auto-detects field types, colors, alignment from field names). Generates AngularJS code (ServiceNow standard) rather than modern frameworks. **Impact/Scope:** Establishes reusable pattern for building code generators with guided workflows in any domain. Architecture: QuestionEngine (collects answers, validates, builds config) → Generator (config → code artifacts) → MCP Server (natural language interface). Applied successfully to ServiceNow dashboards (4,763 lines, 8 MCP tools, 4 table styles). **Pattern:** Code Generator Architecture: (1) QuestionEngine with conditional flows and smart defaults, (2) Type-safe configuration building, (3) Multi-format code generation (XML/JS/CSS/HTML), (4) MCP integration with tools for create/generate/quick/questions/answers/build/code, (5) Template library for common patterns, (6) Smart type inference (field types from names, colors from ServiceNow conventions, alignment from types).", "tags": ["architecture", "pattern", "mcp", "code-generation", "servicenow"], "links": ["https://github.com/consigcody94/servicenow-dashboard-generator"]}
